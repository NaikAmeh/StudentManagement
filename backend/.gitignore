# EF Core Migrations - Design-time files (the actual migration C# files should be committed)
# No common design-time files that need ignoring, actual migrations ARE code.

# Local App Settings Overrides
# appsettings.json is usually committed.
# appsettings.Development.json might contain local-only settings or non-sensitive dev settings.
# If it contains secrets, it should definitely be ignored.
# It's a common practice to ignore it and use User Secrets or environment variables.
appsettings.Development.json
# If you use User Secrets (secrets.json is stored outside the project directory by default)
# But if someone manually places it:
secrets.json
